    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “Starting” With a Credit Card Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        For many people, the first credit card is the first time they interact with revolving credit. Unlike a debit card,
        you are borrowing money temporarily and agreeing to repay it under specific terms set by the issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Starting” with credit cards usually involves three steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Getting approved</strong> – the bank evaluates your income, credit history (if any) and risk profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Receiving a limit</strong> – the maximum you can borrow on the card at any given time.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning the cycle</strong> – how statement dates, due dates and interest calculations work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding these mechanics early makes it easier to avoid late fees, unnecessary interest and long-term problems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Setup -->
    <section id="setup" class="section">
      <h2>Setting Up Your First Card</h2>
      <p>
        Once you are approved, the practical setup phase starts. Typical steps include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activating the card and setting a secure PIN.</li>
        <li>Enabling the mobile app and online banking.</li>
        <li>Adding the card to your digital wallets (phone or watch).</li>
        <li>Setting up alerts for transactions, due dates and large purchases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many issuers allow you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose between e-statements and paper statements.</li>
        <li>Enable automatic payments (full balance, minimum, or fixed amount).</li>
        <li>Lock or freeze the card from the app if something looks suspicious.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A common beginner strategy is to set auto-pay to the <strong>full statement balance</strong> to avoid interest,
        and then track spending via the app throughout the month.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Habits -->
    <section id="habits" class="section">
      <h2>Building Safe Long-Term Habits</h2>
      <p>
        Good credit-card habits started early are easier to maintain than habits you try to fix later. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spending within a budget</strong> – treat the card like a payment method, not extra income.</li>
        <li><strong>Paying on time</strong> – even a single late payment can appear on your credit history.</li>
        <li><strong>Keeping utilization moderate</strong> – many lenders prefer you not to use 100% of your limit.</li>
        <li><strong>Reviewing statements</strong> – to catch errors, fraud or forgotten subscriptions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, these habits can support a stronger credit profile, which may help when you later apply for
        bigger loans like car finance or a mortgage.
